This is the repository for AM10 Group Project, Group 9.
Data used for this project are within the Data folder
Findings are presented as a PowerPoint, visualisations within the PowerPoint and underlying codes that built them were inside the folders for reproducibility.

Our final project focuses on developing robust, data-driven recommendations for Netflix and similar clients on what types of movies they should produce next. We collected and analysed a wide range of data to generate actionable insights and strategic guidance on audience preferences. Through visualisation techniques, we identified key markets and demographic segments, each exhibiting distinct viewing patterns. Overall, action films emerged as the most consistently popular genre across regions, and historically they tend to deliver strong commercial outcomes for production companies.

We complemented this with regression analysis to better understand the drivers of audience interest. Our results suggest that viewers generally favour longer films over shorter ones—illustrated by cases such as the original Justice League compared with the extended Zack Snyder cut. We also found that controversy, whether positive or negative, can heighten audience engagement and ultimately increase revenue. This implies that strategic promotion and encouraging more critical discourse around a film may improve visibility and public interest.

The analytical process was not without challenges. Several variables suffered from missing data or limited interpretability—such as production year, which cannot be meaningfully influenced. We also encountered confounding factors and minor multicollinearity in the regressions, which complicated deeper inference and required careful model validation.
